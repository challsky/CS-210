# CS-210
These files are from Project One of CS 210. This program assignment was to make a program that would
display 2 clocks side by side. One clock is a 12 hour clock and the other is 24 hour clock. The user 
is able to interact with a menu that has multiple options to add a minute, add a second, or add an 
hour. Depending on input, the clocks will change.

I think I did a good job of partioning the code and keeping main.cpp clean and efficient. Each 
function is in its own file and easy to read. By having seperate files for function its make the 
entire program more readable and easier to maintain for myself and others.

If possible, I would like to shorten the code within the fucntions. Possibly formulas could make the 
code less lengthy and help to clean up the function definitions. Going along with that, the function
definitions were the most time consuming given all the lines that go into them. Keeping each situation
straight was a challenge. Testing, testing, and more testing was the only way through. 

Going along with all the testing, comes using test cases. That would be a tool that I think I need
to focus on more and learn how to use. Given this program was relatively simple, as far as what
could go wrong. But a program with more possible outcomes, could become a debugging nightmare fast.
